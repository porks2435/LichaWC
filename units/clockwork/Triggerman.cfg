The dwarves, partial to clockwork, developed a new kind of ranged warfare technology. The triggermen do not use the crossbows or thundersticks of their ancestors, but devices similar to thundersticks but much more complex. None save the dwarves themselves can comprehend the inner-workings of their tubes, but few can hold their ground when confronted with the buzzing cylinders that issue forth from them, in much larger numbers than from their predecessorâ€™s weapons."

The dwarves most proficient with their 'guns' use even larger, more complex ones. These artillerymen fire shells as big as a man's fist at the same rate as their comrades fire smaller shells. Though not as a large as the rocks flung by catapults, the dwarven artillery prove quite effective against fortifications and troops alike."
