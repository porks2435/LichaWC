    description=_ "Fate can be treacherous at times, as quick to offer you a present as to turn it into a burden. When Meloen succeeded in brushing the knowledge of magic's origin with the tip of her mind during a short burst of supreme lucidity, she fused with her environment, against all odds. But her innate insecurity led to ever greater self-doubt and she speculated that luck only was responsible for these events, and not her determination and work. Indeed, she came to believe that misfortune toyed with her life, amusing itself by putting her in a nightmare.
Black cats are simple forest creatures that have turned into hideous chimeras through Meloen's dark thoughts. Although no one knows what kind of magic is behind their power, it seems that any creature that crosses their evil eyes is struck by misfortune."

'- My Lord, I have divined the nature of those beasts' capacity. There is no curse, it is only a mind trick.
- What do you mean, Hogene? Facts prove you wrong, the men are clearly struck by misfortune. Look at them struggle to fight: they seem unable to parry the simplest blow as soon as they meet the damned creatures.
- They are under the effects of some sort of hypnosis, Lieutenant. They are self-deluded into their own misfortune. The men themselves are responsible of their own clumsiness! Fortunately, I have found a way to dispel the clouds in their minds, and restore their ability to fight.'"
