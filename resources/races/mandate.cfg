        description=_"Kobolds are similar in appearance to Saurians, differing for the most part in the blue tint of their scales and amber-red eyes. However, a more crucial difference in the way of life – instead of jungles and swamps, they preferred deep caves and mountains, where they live off underground water, flora and fauna. Kobolds organize themselves in clans, concentrated near generous ore and mineral deposits and underground lakes. In such conditions – with the necessity to make new tunnels and defend their caves from outsiders – the blue lizards have developed the technology of rapid-fire crossbows and chemical explosives.
It is not known for sure whether Kobolds knew about the Great Abyss before or whether they gathered within its vicinity only when Tartarus called for new candidates for the Mandate. But when the Empire of Xian was suffering a state crisis, the blue lizards rapidly consolidated their clans in a desire to acquire the benefits from a doomed civilization. Showering the squares of the cities with arrows and breaking through the walls with mining equipment, they destroyed the Empire of Xian in the shortest possible time. As a sign of their triumph, they seized inhabitants indiscriminately – the living and the dead – and threw them into the hopeless blackness of the Great Abyss.
Although the Kobolds could not hold their power for a long time – having later experienced the onslaught of the Jiangshi who emerged from the Abyss with an army of Terracotta Warriors – the resurrected Xians – they were able to survive the harsh times and remain an important part of the state under the Mandate of Mangus. Kobolds tirelessly manufacture skillful firearms and throwing weapons, as well as engage in mining and underground agriculture – all for the glory of the Empire."

        description=_"Mangus are beast-like giants, easily dwarfing even the tallest sentient races. They rule Tartarus Mandate with an iron fist and are not afraid of joining the battle themselves, swinging their meteor hammers with utter rabidity.

<header>text='Origins'</header>

Mangus were not known in Irdia before their taking of The Mandate. Either they dwelled too deep to meet any other creatures, or they were a recent creation, possibly by Tartarus itself. In any way, Mangus have proven to be successful in the current situation – overthrowing dysfunctional Jiangshi, preserving all the previous ruling races and integrating them into a working society and making an alliance with frivolous yet powerful Yaoguai. As of now, there is no obvious reason for Mangus to lose the favor of the Mandate.

<header>text='Life'</header>

young Mangus appear from depths of Tartarus regularly, but their memory is often blurry as on how they came to life and what they saw deep below. As such, all Mangus consider Tartarus their father and call all other Mangus siblings or brothers. Such friendly addresses although do not prevent Mangus from harsh competition which often results in duels and blood sport. However, despite their brutish appearance, they are usually smart enough to avoid such feuds during war. 
Unlike other races, Mangus do not seem to suffer weaknesses of old age – they do not become senile and fragile, and only get stronger and bigger with years. At a certain point, an old Mangus would decide to make the Great Descent – to go down the Pit of Tartarus, trying to reach the place of their birth. Although this experience is as hazy as their memory of their actual birth, they return somewhat “endarkened” – what Mangus say as opposed to “enlightened”. “Endarkened” Mangus are even stronger and larger than regular brutes, as well as possessing up to three heads or faces. They earn the name of Yelbeghen – “demonic dragon”. They are the elite of Mangus and occupy the highest positions of the Mandate’s society. They still take great pleasure in combat – it would be a great misuse of their new power – usually leaving the most mundane and boring governing work to tireless and incorruptible Jiangshi.

<header>text='Mangus and Worms'</header>

Mangus’ life is strongly linked with one of a Worm. Although Mangus are current holders of the Mandate, they probably would not have achieved such heights without the help of Worms. This relationship cannot be equated to owner-pet, as no Mangus has direct control over a particular Worm and vice-versa, their relationship is mutual and equal. 
Such strong link is understandable, as underground life of such giants as Mangus is barely imaginable, yet Worms provide great help burrowing tunnels for their close friends."

        description=_"Worms, also known as Olgoi Horhoi – are beasts of great size. They can easily fit a boat in their mandibles and are as long as a tree trunk. They may seem like mindless monsters, but there is more to the story. There is some intelligence, a hidden mind slumbering in that enormous mass of dagger-like teeth and foul flesh. Other creatures may not fully understand it, but they feel a Worm’s presence, they feel its pressing will – as if Tartarus whispers through its children.
Wherever there is a Worm, there is also a mangus. Although such an alliance seems at first glance unobvious, it would be difficult for a great-in-size mangus to survive in an underground environment without the help of overgrown burrowing worms. This connection manifests itself in the almost sacred respect from Mangus to the Worms, which can only be overshadowed by their fanaticism for the Great Abyss. Mangus bow and greet worms much like their own kinsmen and celebrate their attainment of old age.

At the same time, worms are by no means pets of mangus, they are independent of them and are not in anyone's keeping. This relationship can be compared to that one of drakes and lizards, although in the case of mangus and worms, this it has truly reached the level of symbiosis."

        id=yaoguai
        male_name=_"race^Yaoguai"
        female_name=_"race^Yaoguai"
        plural_name=_"race^Yaoguai"
        description=_"Yaoguai are magical beings of a dualistic nature. They exist between life and death, wild and civilized, loyal and treacherous. Many dwell in isolated mountains, forests and swamps of the Tartarus Mandate. Although Yaogai serve the State during war and peace alike, their homelands enjoy significant autonomy: they are allowed self-governance without imperial supervision, and outsiders are strictly forbidden from entering the territory of Yaoguai. Thus, the life of these beings is covered in a veil of secrecy even to most whom they ally themselves with.

<header>text='Origins'</header>

The origin of Yaogai is solely based on speculation since the isolation of their communities. If Yaoguai descend from something, it is certainly not human. Although Yaogai like Vixens or Jorogumo have for the most part human-like appearance or traits, in their habits and intelligence they diverge extremely from away from them, especially when peace is no option.
The most likely assumption is that the Yaogai are the result of special rites by ancient cults and wizards, who perfected and improved their familiars, trying to figure out a way of achieving godhood. But with the familiars gaining becoming more power than their masters, they needed their lordship no more. 

<header>text='History'</header>

Since the existence of Yaoguai, they have caused terror to anyone who dared to come close to their lands. Such hostile and protective behavior was especially evident in their interactions with Xian. Although open conflicts were not uncommon, Yaoguai preferred other means of terrorizing their enemies. They often kidnapped children or seduced men for later manipulations or murders. This caused Xian society to be extremely paranoid, and also creative in making wild stories and speculations on Yaoguai.
During the First Mandate, The Mandate of Xian, tensions were especially high. As the unified empire tried to push back the Yaoguai, the creatures stayed low. But in rare moments when they did confront Xian, they were as destructive and violent as never seen before, after which they stayed low again.
Similar situation was established between Yaoguai and Kobolds, who were interested in hunting down Yaoguai for sport. It ended tragically for Kobolds when Yaoguai organized a devastating counter-attack, leaving the blue reptiles vulnerable to incoming forces of Jiangshi and Terracota Warriors. 
During the reign of Jiangshi, the relations between the empire and Yaoguai seemed surprisingly neutral, even non-existent. Yet, Jiangshi were very likely to know of Yaoguai presence. 
Mangus, who came into power after Jiangshi, seemed unaware of Yaoguai at first. However, they soon reached several Yaogui communities with an offering – Yaoguai would become clients of the Mandate, serving their skills to the Empire, while their lands and secrets remain protected. The deal, which seemed suspiciously in favor of Yaoguai, eventually gained its ground. As those tribes accepted the deal and soon learned the benefits of such cooperation, they were offered a second condition to prove their loyalty – they reach out other Yaoguai communities personally and offer them the same deal with the Mandate. Either they accept it, or die by the claws of their own kin. 
In the end, Yaoguai proved their alliance with the Mandate and remain crucial to the life of the Empire.

<header>text='Types'</header>

There are several types of known Yaoguai:
Vixens – are humanoid-like creatures with fox traits – most noticeably – ears and tails, though their limbs also possess likeness to those of foxes. They are most potent in magic among Yaoguai.
Like Vixens, Jorogumo also possess animal and humanoid features, though to a more obvious degree – as their spider bodies have significant size compare to their human halves. 
Although Jiangshi do not live together with Yaoguai, their innate magical abilities and essence are similar, which may suggest their common origin."
